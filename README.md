Problem Description:
This project is aimed to implement as well as design an efficient phonebook for Namibian Telecommunications Company with the use of simple linear data structures. The phonebook is to support the operstions that follow:
Insert- To add anew contact( name and phone number to the phonebook)
Search- To retrieve a contact's phone number by searching their name.
Delete- To remove a contact from the phonebook by name.
Update- To modify an existing contact's phone number.

Data structures and Algorithms explored:
Arrays- Simple to implement and efficient for small datasets 
- Supports insert, search, delete, and update operations
Linked lists- Dynamic memory allocation, which may be useful when the size of the phonebook is not known beforehand.

Future enhancements:
Explore other data structures- If the current implementation's performance is insufficient, explore more advanced data structures such as; balanced trees, skip lists, tries and hash tables.
Improne search efficiency- For huge datasets, search operations may become bottlenecks. Optimizations like binary Search( for sorted arrays)or making use of tries for prefix matching can be explored.
Add persistence- Extend the phonebook to allow to save contacts to disk for persistent storage.

Conclusion:
This phonebook algorithm provides a simple yet efficient solution to basic operations such as insert, search, delete and update while it allows further exploration for more advanced structures when necessary.
